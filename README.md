# Socket Race

## An experimental JS Game using NodeJS + Socket.io

### The Game
This game was created using NodeJS and Socket.IO for academic purposes. The same will be presented as the focus of the lecture "Game JS with Websockets" at the event "1st Open Meeting Pernambuco.JS."

## Install
* git clone https://github.com/djalmaaraujo/socketrace.git
